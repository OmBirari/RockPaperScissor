# Rock, Paper, Scissors Hand Gesture Game

This project is a simple implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using hand gestures. It utilizes the OpenCV and cvzone libraries for computer vision and hand tracking. The game is played against an AI opponent that randomly selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the player's move is determined by hand gestures.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking using OpenCV and cvzone libraries.
- AI opponent with random move selection.
- Rock, Paper, Scissors game logic.
- Score tracking for both AI and player.
